## Description

The `_metadata.py` file defines the structures and logic for handling metadata associated with cached items in the `microbiolink` package. It provides classes and helper functions to manage, store, and retrieve metadata fields, ensuring that each cache entry can be enriched with flexible, structured, and queryable information. This enables advanced search, filtering, and organization of cached data based on user-defined or system-generated metadata.

### Main Components

  Encapsulates the metadata for a cache item, providing methods to set, get, update, and validate metadata fields.
