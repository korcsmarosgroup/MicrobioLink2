This is made possible by the fast execution of Ruff and removes the need to run a dedicated pre-commit step. For instance, in VSCode or Cursor, you can add this to your <code>.vscode/settings.json</code>:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"editor.formatOnType\": true,\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n    \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": {\n        \"source.fixAll.ruff\": \"explicit\",\n        \"source.organizeImports.ruff\": \"explicit\"\n    },\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"charliermarsh.ruff\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, pre-commit hooks can be used to automatically or manually run these tools before each commit. They are defined in <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code>. To install the hooks run <code>poetry run pre-commit install</code>. The hooks are then executed before each commit. For running the hook for all project files (not only the changed ones) run <code>poetry run pre-commit run --all-files</code>.
