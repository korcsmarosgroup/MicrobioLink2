\usage{
check_fastq_files(input_dir, Fastq_file_format, log_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_dir}{The system-based absolute path to the input directory containing the FASTQ files or sample folders.}

\item{Fastq_file_format}{Expected layout of the FASTQ input. Must be:
- 'merged': all FASTQ files are in a single directory.
- 'subdir': each sample has its own subdirectory containing FASTQ files.}

\item{log_file}{Path to the log file where warnings and information messages are written.}
}
\value{
named list: A named list mapping sample prefixes to nested lists of file paths, e.g.:
$sample1
$R1
$"/path/to/SampleA_R1.fastq.gz"
$R2
$"/path/to/SampleA_R2.fastq.gz"

$sample2
$R1
$...
$R2
$...

Only samples that contain \strong{both R1 and R2} files are included.
}
\description{
Validate FASTQ inputs and return only samples with complete paired-end data.
The function scans the inpu directory that contains either:
\itemize{
\item A flat collection of FASTQ files ("merged" layout), or
\item Multiple per-sample subdirectories ("subdir" layout).
}
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Identifies FASTQ files for each sample (R1, R2, and optionally I1).
\item Logs warnings when samples are incomplete (missing R1 or R2)
\item Logs errors and exits when the folder structure is invalid.
\item Produces a named list containing \strong{only samples that have both R1 and R2 FASTQs}
}

The returns named list is suitable for downstream tools that require complete paired FASTQ inputs (e.g. STAR, trimming tools, quantification).

Error codes:
ERROR CODE 5: Invalid Fastq_file_format argument.
ERROR CODE 6: No FASTQ files found in merged layout.
ERROR CODE 7: No sample subdirectories found in subdir layout.
}
